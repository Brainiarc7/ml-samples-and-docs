**Fueling the Artificial Intelligence revolution with gaming!** 

Last weekend, we looked into the role of GPUs and other accelerators in advancing Machine Learning. We had  2 experts on board; Alison Lowndes(via remote presentation) who is responsible for NVIDIA's Artificial Intelligence Developer Relations in the EMEA region and Dennis Mungai, a Linux Systems Engineer and HPC specialist at Boss TV.

The agenda was follows:

1.00 - 1.30 : Arrival
1.30 - 2.00 : Set-up of tools for the code lab
2.00 - 3.00 : Fuelling the Artificial Intelligence revolution with gaming!

{AI, deep learning, robotics, gaming, NVIDIA, research}

**Synopsis:**

Building upon the foundational understanding of how artificial intelligence is applied to multiple problems, this talk explores the phenomenon of deep learning and how NVIDIA enables the entire ecosystem with optimized open-source software and its pioneering hardware based on the graphical processing unit (GPU). Will also cover several use cases and discuss aspects of safety and real-world state-of-the-art research.

**About the Presenters:**

ALISON B. LOWNDES is responsible for NVIDIA's Artificial Intelligence Developer Relations in the EMEA region. A mature graduate in Artificial Intelligence combining technical and theoretical computer science with a physics background. After researching image & feature recognition using GPUs & deep learning at the University of Leeds, Alison joined NVIDIA as a Deep Learning Solutions Architect. She consults on a wide range of AI applications, including planetary defense with NASA, and continues to manage the community of AI & Machine Learning researchers. As AI DevRel she stays knowledgeable in state of the art across all areas of research and advises, teaches and evangelizes NVIDIAâ€™s platform, around the globe.
